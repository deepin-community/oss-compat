oss-compat (6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fully detach the sub-processes waiting to remove the OSS modules, and
    stop waiting if rmmod disappears. (Closes: #737054.)

 -- Stephen Kitt <skitt@debian.org>  Wed, 29 Jan 2014 23:40:28 +0100

oss-compat (5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Stop using "rmmod -w" which is no longer supported. (Closes: #736584.)
  * Standards-Version 3.9.5, no change required.

 -- Stephen Kitt <skitt@debian.org>  Sun, 26 Jan 2014 14:33:37 +0100

oss-compat (4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove oss-compat.conf when removing the package, so it doesn't load
    the OSS modules when configured but not installed. (Closes: #718241.)
  * Remove the OSS modules when removing the package. If anything is using
    the modules, they are queued for removal as soon as they are freed.
  * Switch to debhelper compat level 9.
  * Only recommend osspd on Ubuntu and derivatives; suggest it on Debian
    for now (we need to get the updated prerm or drop the OSS modules from
    the kernel before transitioning to osspd).

 -- Stephen Kitt <skitt@debian.org>  Wed, 21 Aug 2013 22:01:40 +0200

oss-compat (3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use softdep directives in the modprobe configuration. (Closes:
    #660803.)
  * Switch to my Debian address.
  * Use canonical VCS URIs.
  * Drop obsolete Lintian override for module-init-tools dependency.
  * Recommend osspd, which provides OSS emulation using ALSA or PulseAudio
    (LP: #659024, #983707).
  * Standards-Version 3.9.4, no further change required.

 -- Stephen Kitt <skitt@debian.org>  Tue, 18 Jun 2013 15:05:31 +0200

oss-compat (2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Stephen Kitt ]
  * Add VCS information.

  [ Christoph Egger ]
  * Team upload

  * Do not depend on module-init-tools
    * On linux it's transitional for kmod anyway
    * on kfreebsd it got uninstallable due to changes in module-init-tools
      recently (and there's nothing needed on kfreebsd)
  * Make package arch:any so we can simplify Depends: to kmod [linux-any]

 -- Christoph Egger <christoph@debian.org>  Mon, 05 Mar 2012 17:02:54 +0100

oss-compat (1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Switch to single-component versions.
  * Declare the package is "Multi-Arch: foreign", thanks to Steve Langasek
    for the hint! (Closes: #651335.)
  * Make /etc/modprobe.d/oss-compat.conf a file, handling the various
    upgrade cases, and only removing it on purge. (Closes: #649507.)
    (LP: #340873)
  * Add kmod as an alternative dependency to avoid preventing
    module-init-tools' removal.

 -- Stephen Kitt <steve@sk2.org>  Sun, 15 Jan 2012 14:06:16 +0100

oss-compat (0.0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Team upload.
  * Re-upload without changes, because the last binary upload changed the
    Maintainer field to myself by accident, which made the package look
    hijacked.

 -- Bruno "Fuddl" Kleinert <fuddl@debian.org>  Wed, 08 Jun 2011 17:10:12 +0200

oss-compat (0.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer. (Closes: #594376.)
  * Only modprobe snd. (Closes: #390747.)
  * Update copyright file, switch to DEP-5 format.
  * Drop obsolete modutils dependency.
  * Switch to dh7 short form.
  * Specify source format "3.0 (native)".
  * Override depends-on-essential-package-without-using-version
    explicitly; the dependencies allow this package to be installed on
    hurd.
  * Standards-Version 3.9.2, no further change required.

 -- Stephen Kitt <steve@sk2.org>  Mon, 06 Jun 2011 07:17:14 +0200

oss-compat (0.0.4+nmu3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * debian/{postinst,prerm}

 -- Michael Biebl <biebl@debian.org>  Wed, 18 Mar 2009 12:44:14 +0100

oss-compat (0.0.4+nmu2) unstable; urgency=high

  [ Frank Lichtenheld ]
  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Add the "install snd-{mixer,pcm,seq}" items alsa-base previously
    had. Also remove the "install snd" item, we have no guarantee
    that is is used anyway (see #397765).  (Closes: #500460)

  [ Martín Ferrari ]
  * Uploading Frank's changes.
